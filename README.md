Migrating from a previous planner version can be done by just copying a whole page of writing from the old version, and pasting in to this new versions. Spacing will match.

Year and Week sheets sourced from the https://www.calendarpedia.co.uk/ resource.  Merged together, modified, hyperlinks bookmarks and Cornell style Tasks sheet added.
