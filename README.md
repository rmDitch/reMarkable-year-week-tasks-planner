Year and Week sheets sourced from the https://www.calendarpedia.co.uk/ resource.  Merged together, added hyperlinks, bookmarks and Cornell style Tasks sheet. Simplified the year view and colours for better e-ink support. Added tab style page headers & clickable Year & Task icons ( â™¡ palm os).   

(Migrating from a previous version can be done by just copying a whole page of writing from the old version, and pasting in to this new versions. Spacing will match).
